# driver_drowziness_detection# 🚘 Safe Driver Coaching System

A Personal AI Driving Coach to Make Roads Safer for Everyone  
> _"Driving safe isn't just about obeying speed limits. It's about awareness, habits, and behavior."_  

---

## 📌 Overview

Every year, millions of road accidents occur due to **driver error**, with **57% caused by distracted driving**. Existing systems mostly target aggressive behavior like speeding or harsh braking. However, **distractions, drowsiness**, and **lack of situational awareness** are often overlooked.

The **Safe Driver Coaching System** is an **AI-based, open-source driver monitoring solution** that works like a **personal driving coach**. It leverages computer vision and sensor fusion to monitor and improve your driving behavior in real-time.

## 🎯 Goals

- Reduce accidents by **monitoring and correcting driver behavior**
- Make **driver monitoring technology affordable and accessible**
- Provide **feedback just like a real coach**
- Encourage safer habits like:
  - Wearing seat belts
  - Checking mirrors
  - Avoiding distractions
  - Maintaining alertness
